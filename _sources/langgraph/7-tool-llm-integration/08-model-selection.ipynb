    "## Model Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model selection** in LangGraph is the systematic process of **choosing, routing, and coordinating LLMs** inside a graph so that each step of a workflow uses the **most appropriate model** for its task, subject to constraints on **cost, latency, quality, safety, and reliability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike simple applications that bind a single model globally, LangGraph treats models as **first-class, dynamic execution resources**.\n",
