    "\n",
    "**Prompt Routing** in LangGraph is a **control mechanism** that dynamically selects **which prompt, model, or tool pipeline** should process an input based on the **current state, task type, or intermediate results**.\n",
    "It enables **adaptive, multi-skill, multi-model, and multi-agent systems** within a single workflow.\n",

      "Result:\n",
      " Transformers are a type of neural network architecture designed for processing sequential data, particularly in natural language processing tasks. They use a mechanism called self-attention to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence, allowing them to capture long-range dependencies and relationships. Transformers consist of an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder processes the input data and the decoder generates the output. They have become the foundation for many state-of-the-art models, such as BERT and GPT.\n",

      "3. **Market Research**: Analyze competitors and market trends to identify opportunities.\n",
      "4. **Feature List**: Create a list of core features and functionalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Create a Project Team\n",
      "1. **Identify Roles**: Determine the necessary roles (e.g., project manager, developers, designers, QA testers).\n",
      "2. **Assign Responsibilities**: Allocate tasks and responsibilities to team members.\n",
      "3. **Set Communication Channels**: Establish how the team will communicate (e.g., Slack, email, project management tools).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Develop a Project Timeline\n",
      "1. **Milestones**: Identify key milestones (e.g., completion of wireframes, beta testing).\n",
      "2. **Task Breakdown**: Break down the project into smaller tasks and assign deadlines.\n",
      "3. **Gantt Chart**: Create a Gantt chart to visualize the project timeline.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Design the App\n",
      "1. **Wireframes**: Create wireframes to outline the app’s layout and user interface.\n",
      "2. **User Experience (UX) Design**: Focus on the user journey and interactions.\n",
      "3. **User Interface (UI) Design**: Develop the visual design elements, including color schemes and typography.\n",
      "4. **Prototyping**: Create a clickable prototype for initial user feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 5: Development\n",
      "1. **Choose Technology Stack**: Decide on the programming languages, frameworks, and tools to be used.\n",
      "2. **Backend Development**: Set up the server, database, and APIs.\n",
      "3. **Frontend Development**: Build the app’s user interface and integrate it with the backend.\n",
      "4. **Regular Check-ins**: Conduct regular meetings to track progress and address any issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 6: Testing\n",
      "1. **Quality Assurance (QA)**: Conduct thorough testing, including functional, usability, and performance testing.\n",
      "2. **Beta Testing**: Release a beta version to a select group of users for feedback.\n",
      "3. **Bug Fixes**: Address any issues or bugs identified during testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 7: Launch\n",
      "1. **App Store Preparation**: Prepare app store listings, including descriptions, screenshots, and promotional materials.\n",
      "2. **Launch Strategy**: Develop a marketing plan for the app launch (e.g., social media, press releases).\n",
      "3. **Launch the App**: Release the app on relevant platforms (e.g., Apple App Store, Google Play Store).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 8: Post-Launch Activities\n",
      "1. **User Feedback**: Collect and analyze user feedback to identify areas for improvement.\n",
      "2. **Updates and Maintenance**: Plan for regular updates and maintenance to fix bugs and add new features.\n",
      "3. **Marketing and Promotion**: Continue marketing efforts to increase visibility and downloads.\n",
      "4. **Performance Monitoring**: Use analytics tools to track user engagement and app performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 9: Review and Reflect\n",
      "1. **Project Review**: Conduct a post-mortem analysis to evaluate what went well and what could be improved.\n",
      "2. **Documentation**: Document lessons learned and best practices for future projects.\n",
      "3. **Future Planning**: Consider future updates or new features based on user feedback and market trends.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "By following this step-by-step plan, you can effectively manage the development of a mobile app from conception to launch and beyond. Each step is crucial for ensuring that the app meets user needs and achieves its intended goals.\n"
