    "## Graph Execution Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This section covers **the foundational concepts of LangGraph's execution model**, explaining how graphs are constructed, compiled, and executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll learn about **directed graphs, state machines, cyclic patterns, conditional routing**, and the core mechanisms that power LangGraph's deterministic and non-deterministic execution strategies. Understanding these concepts is essential for building **predictable, controllable, and debuggable agent workflows**.\n",
