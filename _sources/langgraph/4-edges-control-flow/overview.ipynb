    "## Edges & Control Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "This section examines **how execution flows through LangGraph graphs** using edges, conditional routing, dynamic branching, and loop control mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll master techniques for **orchestrating complex decision trees, implementing intelligent routing logic, and creating adaptive workflows** that respond to runtime conditions. Control flow patterns are fundamental to building **autonomous agents that can reason about their next actions**.\n",
