    "\n",
    "This section explores **long-term memory systems, checkpointing strategies, and state persistence mechanisms** that enable agents to maintain context across sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll learn how to **implement conversation memory, create persistent agent state, use vector stores for semantic recall**, and design systems that remember and learn from past interactions. Memory is fundamental to creating **agents that improve over time**.\n",
